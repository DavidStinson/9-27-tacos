# Your task is to...

Construct routes, models, views, and controller functions to support the below functionality:
<!-- - Define a taco model with two fields: -->
  <!-- - name, a string -->
  <!-- - tasty, a boolean -->
<!-- - Build a tacos index page -->
  <!-- - Redirect HTTP requests to localhost:3000 to this index page -->
  <!-- - This page should link to a page that will be used to add a taco -->
  <!-- - This page will show all the tacos, if there are any -->
  <!-- - Each taco on this page should have a link to a taco show page -->
  <!-- - If there are no tacos, a message communicating such will be displayed -->
<!-- - Build a new taco page -->
  <!-- - New tacos will be added here -->
  <!-- - There should be inputs on this page that correspond with the fields in your model -->
<!-- - Build a show taco page -->
  <!-- - This page should show all the information about a taco -->
  <!-- - A taco should be able to be deleted from this page -->
  - If you implement the bonus functionality, there should be a link to edit a taco on this page

<!-- ## Hints -->
<!-- - You'll probably want to start with the e-gen-replacement template -->
<!-- - You'll need to create a database connection, along with using a `.env` file -->
  <!-- - You'll need to add a couple of packages to accomplish this -->
<!-- - You'll also need to add the method-override package  -->

## Bonus
- Add the ability to update a taco - implement this by adding a new edit page and pre-fill the input values on that page to match the current state of the taco that is being edited
